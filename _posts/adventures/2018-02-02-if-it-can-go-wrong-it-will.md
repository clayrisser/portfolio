It’s dark and rainy as I step off the train at the station, but hey, isn’t that normal for London. My ears are still ringing from the babies crying on the airplane, but eh that’s normal too. I had a bit of trouble getting to this station, went the wrong way on a few tubes, but again that’s pretty normal for me.

Things seem to be going great. But, of course, what can go wrong will go wrong. I walk up to the desk at my hostel to be informed they only accept cash. That’s no big deal though. I came prepared. I already let my bank know I’d be in London. I find one of the dozens of ATM’s around that accept VISA. Then the unthinkable happens. The ATM consciously decides to malfunction and eats my card. I guess he was hungry. I stand on the street for a good 30 minutes trying to process this misfortune. I am slightly hoping the ATM gets indigestion.

I then remember I have a credit card, but soon “discover” most places in London do not recognize Discover. Ok, now that’s an extreme case of bad luck. In a few moments, I go from adventurous traveler to homeless on the streets of rainy cold London. What would you do when you have no money, and you’re stuck in a city half-way around the world? Um, yeah also your phone is dead, and your charger doesn’t work with the type G wall socket. I decided to use some magic and convince the hostel to let me spend the night on their tab. Ok, I’m tired. Let’s deal with this problem tomorrow . . .

. . . in the morning I’m able to find a USB socket in a McDonald’s, and Discover helps me “discover” one of the few ATM’s that supports their card. I navigate my way to the ATM only to find that it was turned off and unplugged. After more phone calls I finally find another ATM to try. This one has a Discover sticker on it, so things should work this time. Well, this ATM had another trick I did not account. It decided (probably consciously) to freeze and crash. After more phone calls and waiting for an ATM technician to come and fix it, I finally get some money to pay for my stay in London.

I thought I was going to have to be creative to find adventures to write down.
